# Hey There :wave:

## This was my first project in REACT!!

In this project, I created a web app that calculates a mortgage payment based off your loan amount, APR and loan terms.  I really had a lot of fun(and frustration) building this app.  Managing the state can be a bear, at least for me since this was my first project.

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing.  Install the necessary dependencies via the terminal by typing 'npm install'. Next, in the terminal, type 'node server/index.js' to start the app on the local node server. Open localhost:3000 in the browser of your choice.  

## ENJOY! :ok_hand:
